  # Fix Student Comments RLS for Anonymous Access
  
  1. Changes
    - Drop all existing complex RLS policies that check auth.jwt()
    - Create simple policies that allow:
      - Anyone authenticated (via custom system) can view comments
      - Anyone authenticated can insert comments (validation happens in app layer)
      - Comment authors can update/delete their own comments
    
  2. Security
    - RLS still enabled
    - Application layer validates teacher/admin roles
    - Comments table has commenter_role and commented_by_id for tracking
