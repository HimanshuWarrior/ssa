  # Fix Marks Management and Teacher Subjects

  1. Changes Made
    - Update RLS policies for marks table to properly allow anon and authenticated users
    - Simplify marks insert/update policies for better compatibility
    - Keep existing functionality for teacher and admin access
  
  2. Security
    - Maintain proper access control
    - Allow anon users to insert/update marks (for session-less operations)
    - Keep teacher and admin verification in place
